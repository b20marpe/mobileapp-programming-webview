    <h1>Assignment 2 WebView</h1>
    <p>This is a very simple app that can change between an internal web page and an external web page.</p>
    <p>The page you are on now is considered the internal web page which only has this text about the app, so if you want to go to the external web page just click the three dots in the top right corner and pick External Web Page.</p>
    <p>This will take you to the website www.his.se which you can look around. There is not much else to this app.</p>
